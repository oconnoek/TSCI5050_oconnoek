#' ## Assignment
#'
#' To store a value as variable `foo` in R the convention is to use the
#' `<-` operator, not `=`. This makes it easier to distinguish stand-alone
#' expressions from function arguments.

#+ assignment_operator
foo <- 500;
bar <- foo <- 500;
bar <- foo;
#' It's not a formal rule, it's rarely even written down, but `foo`, `baz`,
#' `bat`, etc. are throw-away variables people use for testing. If you need more
#' test variables, just make up three letter ones that start with `b`.
#' If you see one of those in a script you're reviewing it means it is left over
#' from when that code was being debugged. Example code shared with this class
#' will usually use `foo` and friends to represent the parts of an expression
#' that should be replaced with whatever values you are using instead of being
#' used literally. Shorter than having to write `YOURFUNCTIONHERE` or
#' `YOURARGUMENTHERE` each time.
#'
#' This is not specific to R-- it's just a little quirk of programming culture
#' in general. A quirk with a practical consequence: _never use `foo`, `bar`,
#' `baz`, `bat`, etc. in your production (i.e. finalized) code_ because
#' otherwise you or somebody else debugging your code will attempt to use those
#' names as test variables and in some situations this could overwrite the
#' existing variables!
#'
#' ## Comments
#'
#' `#'` This indicates that this line should be formatted as text. It must be
#' the first two characters in that line in order to work.
#'
#' `#+` This indicates that the following lines (until the next #' or #+) should
#' be treated as a "code chunk". I.e. the next lines (but not this one) will be
#' run, the code will be displayed according to your settings and the results
#' will be displayed according to your settings.
#'
#' `#` This is an ordinary comment. Everything after it on the same line is not
#' executed.
#'
#' # Functions and Data Types
#'
#' ## Functions and Simple Data Types
#'
#' ### Numeric values. 
#' 
#' You can do arithmetic on them: `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `^`, `log()`,
#' `exp()`, `sqrt()`

#+ assignment_numeric
foo <- 2+2; foo
foo <- 5*2; foo
foo <- log(2); foo
foo <- exp(100); foo
log(foo)
bar <- 5*5; bar
whatisthis(bar);
print(foo <- 42)
print (bar <-67)
log(((foo*3)+(bar+2)*sqrt(144)+exp(10)))

#' ### Character strings. 
#' 
#' Create these by wrapping single (`'`) or double (`"`)
#' quotes around the value.
#+ assignment_string
a <- "Donot panic"; a
b <- 'Donot panic'; b
c <- "Don't panic"; c
d <- 'The "Heart of Gold" comes equipped with heated leather seats and an infinite improbability drive'; d
e <- 42; e
e <- "42"; e

#' ### Logical values.
#' 
#' These are `TRUE` or `FALSE`. They can be created using `>`, `<`,
#' `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`, `&`, `|`, and `!`
#+ assignment_logical
a <- foo > 25; a           # greater than
b <- foo >= 40; b          # greater or equal to
c <- foo != 42; c          # not equal -- ! is the 'not' operator
d <- foo == 42; d          # equal -- == is the equal operator (as opposed to = which is assignment)
e <- foo <50 & bar<100 ; e #  AND operator
f <- foo<50 | bar>100; f   #  OR operator
g <- !(bar>50); g          #  NOT operator can be used with any TRUE/FALSE expression

#' ### Missing values
#' 
#' Missing values are represented by `NA` (no quotes for any of these). Null
#' values are _not_ the same as missing and they are represented by `NULL`. In
#' some circumstances you might also run into `Inf`, `-Inf`, and `NaN`. These
#' often indicate errors somewhere else in your code.

#' ### Dates and times
#' 
#' Dates and times. Can be created with the `Sys.Date()` or `Sys.time()`
#' functions or converted from a character string using `as.Date()`.

#+ assignment_datetime
Sys.Date()
Sys.time()
#?as.Date
my_date <- "2022-01-31"; #' create example date
print (my_date)       ; #' print my_date variable
class (my_date)       ; #' check class of the variable
new_date <- as.Date(my_date) ; #' convert character string
new_date                      ; #' print new_date
class(new_date)               ;#' check class of new_date
as.Date(new_date, tryFormats = c("%y-%m-%d"))

#' ### Factors
#' 
#' Factors are basically integers that have labels. They are a human-readable
#' alternative to using integer codes for discrete data. These will make more
#' sense after we talk about vectors in the next section.

#+ factor_example

#+ assignment_wierd

#' ## Data Structures
#'
#' Of course we usually need to work with variables bundled together, not single
#' values.
#'
#' ### Vectors
#'
#' The default data structure in R is a `vector`. You create one with the `c()`
#' command with any number of arguments. All items in a vector have to be the
#' same type.

#+ vectors_c
print(foo <- c(56,78,34,97,2,86))
print(baz <- c(34,23,94,3,12,53))
#' Since the default data structure in R is a `vector`, if you
#' create some sort of simple value you are creating a `vector` even if you are
#' not using `c()`... it just happens to be a `vector` of length 1. These
#' are identical, and both return `1` when used with the `length()` function.

#+ vectors_length1
length(foo)
#' If you want to create a sequence of consecutive integers, you can use the `:`
#' operator.

#+ vectors_sequence
25:76
65:38
-32:12
seq_len(12)
seq(-9.7, 8.3,by=0.1)

#' In most other languages, you need to use a `for` loop in order to perform
#' some sort of change to a series of values. In R, you often don't have to
#' when you are working with vectors because a lot of functions (including all
#' the arithmetic and logical ones above) and be applied to a vector and they
#' work. If the function involves multiple vectors (e.g. `+`), usually you'll
#' want all of them to be either the same length or length 1.

#+ vectors_operators
foo+6
foo+baz
foo>=34
baz<=23
bob <- baz<=23
c(baz,foo)
c(baz,foo,"76")
# These work with all arithmetic operators
#' You can assign names to some or all members of a vector when you create it.
#' You can also assign or re-assign names later using the `names()` function.

#+ vectors_names1, error=TRUE
jar <- c(a="cat", best="dog", c= "fish", slow="turtle")
print(jar)
# jar[best]
jar["best"]
jar[c("best","c")]
#' You can also use it to see the currently assigned names.

#+ vectors_names2
names(jar) <- c("libby", "beau", "bob", "bob2") # renaming
print(jar)
names(jar)
names(jar)[3]
names(jar)[3] <- "milo" # renames only one element
jar
#' You can subset a vector by using `[...]` with the `...` replaced by _another_
#' vector, of integers indicating which positions you want to extract. Or you
#' could use a vector of names.

#+ vectors_subset1
foo[3]
#' If you just need a single value, use a single name or number.

#+ vectors_subset2

#' If you need a series of adjacent values, use `:`. If you need several
#' adjacent series with interruptions between them, use `c()` with `:`
#' expressions separated by commas `,`.

#+ vectors_subset3
foo[c(1,2,3)]
foo[1:3]
foo[c(1:3,5:6)]
baz
bob
baz[bob] # pulled the vector less than equal to 23
print(foo)
summary(foo)
table(foo)
table(jar) # frequency table
bat <- sample(1:10, 30, replace = TRUE)
table(bat)
bat <- sample(1:10, 30, replace = TRUE)*1000
table(bat)
bat
head(bat) # top 6 elements
tail(bat) # last 6 elements
diff(bat) # difference between two values
sum(bat) # sums all values
seq_along(bat) # sequence all values
sum(bat, na.rm= TRUE) # for missing values
#' Other useful functions for exploring vectors: `length()`, `summary()`,
#' `table()`, `head()`, `tail()`, `sum()`, `diff()`, `seq_along()`.

#+ vectors_explore


#' Here are some aggregation functions. For these, make sure to use `na.rm=T` if
#' your vector has `NA`s in it... `max()`, `min()`, `mean()`, `median()`,
#' `quantile()`.
quantile(bat) # tells quantiles
quantile(bat, na.rm=TRUE)
sum(bat)
min(bat)
max(bat)
#+ vectors_aggregate

#' ### Data Frames
#'
#' You can bundle several vectors of the same length together into a
#' `data.frame` using the `data.frame()` command. A `data.frame` is a tabular
#' data structure where the columns can be different types from each other
#' (though within each column the type will be uniform because each column is
#' still a vector). Most data in R is in the form of a `data.frame` or a class
#' that inherits from `data.frame`. The `dplyr` package makes working with
#' `data.frames` easier and a lot of attention will be devoted to `dplyr`
#' [below](#data-frames-indepth). For now, here are some basic commands for
#' exploring `data.frames`: `dim()`, `nrow()`, `ncol()`, `names()` and (for
#' small datasets) `plot()`.

#+ df_explore

sample(seq_len(nrow(iris)), 10)  # sample without replacement

iris0 <- iris[sample(seq_len(nrow(iris)), 10),]

#' How to select coulmns in dataset
